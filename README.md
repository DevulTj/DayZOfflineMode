# DayZOfflineMode Modification
## Made by DevulTj
## Original script by Arkensor, modified to fit the DayZ developers' new offlineMode mission.

# Installation:
* Ensure you are on the 0.63 Stress Test build - find out [here](https://dayz.com/blog/0-63-stress-tests) if you are, and set it up correctly.
* Download this repository.
* Place all the files (except the SourceCode directory; though it does not matter) into your DayZ directory, replace **all** files if required.
* **NOTE:** Make backups of the Missions folder and dta/scripts.pbo file so you can revert if needed.
* Click play DayZ, and click DayZ Offline.
* Done!

# How do I make my own changes?
* If you have a PBO Manager, you must edit the files inside the SourceCode/scripts folder.
* Pack it to your own scripts.pbo.
* And finally, place it into your DayZ dta folder.
