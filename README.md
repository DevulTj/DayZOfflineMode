# DayZOfflineMode Modification
## Made by DevulTj
## Original script by Arkensor, modified to fit the DayZ developers' new offlineMode mission.

# Installation:
Download this repository.
Place all the files into your DayZ directory, replace **all** files if required.
**NOTE:** Make backups of the Missions folder and dta/scripts.pbo file so you can revert if needed.

# Controls:
* T - Teleport at the position you are looking at
* O - Spawn a random infected (Zombies)
* O + CTRL - Spawn a doge (Actually a wolf, but you can pet him if you have godmode enabled!)
* O + SHIFT - Spawn a random animal
* R - Reload the weapon and refill the ammo (Infinite ammo)
* P - Display your current position in the chat and print it to your logfiles (See logfiles section for their location)
* B - Toggle debug monitor
* K - (double tap) Restart the mission (useful when you spawned too much of everything @ 5 fps)
* N - Spawn the Sedan (not driveable in the current build of DayZ, sorry)
* DELETE - Open the DayZ developer admin tool
* INSERT - Toggle free camera. This teleports your player to the position you looked at when turning it off
